<section class="level2" id="why-ocaml">
<h2>Why OCaml?</h2>
<p>Programming languages matter. They affect the reliability, security,
and efficiency of the code you write, as well as how easy it is to read,
refactor, and extend. The languages you know can also change how you
think, influencing the way you design software even when you’re not
using them.</p>
<p>We wrote this book because we believe in the importance of
programming languages, and that OCaml in particular is an important
language to learn. Both of us have been using OCaml in our academic and
professional lives for over 20 years, and in that time we’ve come to see
it as a powerful tool for building complex software systems. This book
aims to make this tool available to a wider audience, by providing a
clear guide to what you need to know to use OCaml effectively in the
real world.</p>
<p>What makes OCaml special is that it occupies a sweet spot in the
space of programming language designs. It provides a combination of
efficiency, expressiveness and practicality that is matched by no other
language. That is in large part because OCaml is an elegant combination
of a set of language features that have been developed over the last 60
years. These include: <a data-secondary="key features of" data-primary="OCaml" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Garbage collection</em> for automatic memory management, now
a common feature of modern, high-level languages.</p></li>
<li><p><em>First-class functions</em> that can be passed around like
ordinary values, as seen in JavaScript, Common Lisp, and C#.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Static type-checking</em> to increase performance and reduce
the number of runtime errors, as found in Java and C#.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Parametric polymorphism</em>, which enables the construction
of abstractions that work across different data types, similar to
generics in Java, Rust, and C# and templates in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>Good support for <em>immutable programming</em>, <em>i.e.</em>,
programming without making destructive updates to data structures. This
is present in traditional functional languages like Scheme, and is also
commonly found in everything from distributed, big-data frameworks to
user-interface toolkits.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Type inference</em>, so you don’t need to annotate every
variable in your program with its type. Instead, types are inferred
based on how a value is used. Available in a limited form in C# with
implicitly typed local variables, and in C++11 with its
<code>auto</code> keyword.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Algebraic data types</em> and <em>pattern matching</em> to
define and manipulate complex data structures. Available in Scala, Rust,
and F#.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of you will know and love all of these features, and for others
they’ll be largely new, but most of you will have seen some of them in
other languages that you’ve used. As we’ll demonstrate over the course
of this book, there is something transformative about having all these
features together and able to interact in a single language. Despite
their importance, these ideas have made only limited inroads into
mainstream languages, and when they do arrive there, like first-class
functions in C# or parametric polymorphism in Java, it’s typically in a
limited and awkward form. The only languages that completely embody
these ideas are <em>statically typed, functional programming
languages</em> like OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala, Rust, and Standard
ML.<a data-secondary="benefits of" data-primary="OCaml" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Among this worthy set of languages, OCaml stands apart because it
manages to provide a great deal of power while remaining highly
pragmatic. The compiler has a straightforward compilation strategy that
produces performant code without requiring heavy optimization and
without the complexities of dynamic just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
This, along with OCaml’s strict evaluation model, makes runtime behavior
easy to predict. The garbage collector is <em>incremental</em>, letting
you avoid large garbage collection (GC)-related pauses, and
<em>precise</em>, meaning it will collect all unreferenced data (unlike
many reference-counting collectors), and the runtime is simple and
highly portable.</p>
<p>All of this makes OCaml a great choice for programmers who want to
step up to a better programming language, and at the same time get
practical work done.</p>
<section class="level3" id="a-brief-history">
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p>OCaml was written in 1996 by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien
Doligez, and Didier Rémy at INRIA in France. It was inspired by a long
line of research into ML starting in the 1960s, and continues to have
deep links to the academic community.<a data-secondary="history
of" data-primary="OCaml" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>ML was originally the <em>meta language</em> of the LCF (Logic for
Computable Functions) proof assistant released by Robin Milner in 1972
(at Stanford, and later at Cambridge). ML was turned into a compiler in
order to make it easier to use LCF on different machines, and it was
gradually turned into a full-fledged system of its own by the 1980s.</p>
<p>The first implementation of Caml appeared in 1987. It was created by
Ascánder Suárez (as part of the Formel project at INRIA headed by Gérard
Huet) and later continued by Pierre Weis and Michel Mauny. In 1990,
Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez built a new implementation called Caml
Light that was based on a bytecode interpreter with a fast, sequential
garbage collector. Over the next few years useful libraries appeared,
such as Michel Mauny’s syntax manipulation tools, and this helped
promote the use of Caml in education and research teams.</p>
<p>Xavier Leroy continued extending Caml Light with new features, which
resulted in the 1995 release of Caml Special Light. This improved the
executable efficiency significantly by adding a fast native code
compiler that made Caml’s performance competitive with mainstream
languages such as C++. A module system inspired by Standard ML also
provided powerful facilities for abstraction and made larger-scale
programs easier to construct.</p>
<p>The modern OCaml emerged in 1996, when a powerful and elegant object
system was implemented by Didier Rémy and Jérôme Vouillon. This object
system was notable for supporting many common object-oriented idioms in
a statically type-safe way, whereas the same idioms required runtime
checks in languages such as C++ or Java. In 2000, Jacques Garrigue
extended OCaml with several new features such as polymorphic methods,
variants, and labeled and optional arguments.</p>
<p>The last two decades has seen OCaml attract a significant user base,
and language improvements have been steadily added to support the
growing commercial and academic codebases. By 2012, the OCaml 4.0
release had added Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs) and
first-class modules to increase the flexibility of the language. Since
then, OCaml has had a steady yearly release cadence, and OCaml 5.0 with
multicore support is around the corner in 2022. There is also fast
native code support for the latest CPU architectures such as x86_64,
ARM, RISC-V and PowerPC, making OCaml a good choice for systems where
resource usage, predictability, and performance all matter.</p>

<section class="level3" id="the-core-standard-library">
<h3>The <code>Base</code> Standard Library</h3>
<p>However good it is, a language on its own isn’t enough. You also need
a set of libraries to build your applications on. A common source of
frustration for those learning OCaml is that the standard library that
ships with the compiler is limited, covering only a subset of the
functionality you would expect from a general-purpose standard library.
That’s because the standard library isn’t really a general-purpose tool;
its fundamental role is in bootstrapping the compiler, and has been
purposefully kept small and portable.</p>
<p>Happily, in the world of open source software, nothing stops
alternative libraries from being written to supplement the
compiler-supplied standard library. <code>Base</code> is an example of
such a library, and it’s the standard library we’ll use through most of
this book. <a data-primary="Base standard library" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Jane Street, a company that has been using OCaml for more than 20
years, developed the code in <code>Base</code> for its own internal use,
but from the start designed it with an eye toward being a
general-purpose standard library. Like the OCaml language itself,
<code>Base</code> is engineered with correctness, reliability, and
performance in mind. It’s also designed to be easy to install and highly
portable. As such, it works on every platform OCaml does, including
UNIX, macOS, Windows, and JavaScript.</p>
<p><code>Base</code> is distributed with a set of syntax extensions that
provide useful new functionality to OCaml, and there are additional
libraries that are designed to work well with it, including
<code>Core</code>, an extension to <code>Base</code> that includes a
wealth of new data structures and tools; and <code>Async</code>, a
library for concurrent programming of the kind that often comes up when
building user interfaces or networked applications. All of these
libraries are distributed under a liberal Apache 2 license to permit
free use in hobby, academic, and commercial settings.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="the-ocaml-platform">
<h3>The OCaml Platform</h3>
<p><code>Base</code> is a comprehensive and effective standard library,
but there’s much more OCaml software out there. A large community of
programmers has been using OCaml since its first release in 1996, and
has generated many useful libraries and tools. We’ll introduce some of
these libraries in the course of the examples presented in the
book.<a data-secondary="third-party libraries for" data-primary="OCaml" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The installation and management of these third-party libraries is
made much easier via a package management tool known as <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">opam</a>. We’ll explain more about opam
as the book unfolds, but it forms the basis of the OCaml Platform, which
is a set of tools and libraries that, along with the OCaml compiler,
lets you build real-world applications quickly and effectively.
Constituent tools of the OCaml Platform include the <a href="https://dune.build">dune</a> build system and a language server to
integrate with popular editors such as Visual Studio Code (or Emacs or
Vim).</p>
<p>We’ll also use opam for installing the <code>utop</code> command-line
interface. This is a modern interactive tool that supports command
history, macro expansion, module completion, and other niceties that
make it much more pleasant to work with the language. We’ll be using
<code>utop</code> throughout the book to let you step through the
examples interactively.</p>

<section class="level2" id="about-this-book">
<h2>About This Book</h2>
<p><em>Real World OCaml</em> is aimed at programmers who have some
experience with conventional programming languages, but not specifically
with statically typed functional programming. Depending on your
background, many of the concepts we cover will be new, including
traditional functional-programming techniques like higher-order
functions and immutable data types, as well as aspects of OCaml’s
powerful type and module systems.</p>
<p>If you already know OCaml, this book may surprise you. Base redefines
most of the standard namespace to make better use of the OCaml module
system and expose a number of powerful, reusable data structures by
default. Older OCaml code will still interoperate with Base, but you may
need to adapt it for maximal benefit. All the new code that we write
uses Base, and we believe the Base model is worth learning; it’s been
successfully used on large, multimillion-line codebases and removes a
big barrier to building sophisticated applications in OCaml.</p>
<p>Code that uses only the traditional compiler standard library will
always exist, but there are other online resources for learning how that
works. <em>Real World OCaml</em> focuses on the techniques the authors
have used in their personal experience to construct scalable, robust
software systems.</p>
<section class="level3" id="what-to-expect">
<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p><em>Real World OCaml</em> is split into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part I covers the language itself, opening with a guided tour
designed to provide a quick sketch of the language. Don’t expect to
understand everything in the tour; it’s meant to give you a taste of
many different aspects of the language, but the ideas covered there will
be explained in more depth in the chapters that follow.</p>
<p>After covering the core language, Part I then moves onto more
advanced features like modules, functors, and objects, which may take
some time to digest. Understanding these concepts is important, though.
These ideas will put you in good stead even beyond OCaml when switching
to other modern languages, many of which have drawn inspiration from
ML.</p></li>
<li><p>Part II builds on the basics by working through useful tools and
techniques for addressing common practical applications, from
command-line parsing to asynchronous network programming. Along the way,
you’ll see how some of the concepts from Part I are glued together into
real libraries and tools that combine different features of the language
to good effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Part III discusses OCaml’s runtime system and compiler toolchain.
It is remarkably simple when compared to some other language
implementations (such as Java’s or .NET’s CLR). Reading this part will
enable you to build very-high-performance systems, or to interface with
C libraries. This is also where we talk about profiling and debugging
techniques using tools such as GNU <code>gdb</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<section class="level3" id="installation-instructions">
<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<p><em>Real World OCaml</em> uses some tools that we’ve developed while
writing this book. Some of these resulted in improvements to the OCaml
compiler, which means that you will need to ensure that you have an
up-to-date development environment (using the 4.13.1 version of the
compiler). The installation process is largely automated through the
opam package manager. Instructions on how to set it up and what packages
to install can be found at <a href="http://dev.realworldocaml.org/install.html">the installation
page</a>.<a data-primary="installation instructions" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a><a data-secondary="installation instructions" data-primary="OCaml" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Some of the libraries we use, notably <code>Base</code>, work
anywhere OCaml does, and in particular work on Windows and JavaScript.
The examples in Part I of the book will for the most part stick to such
highly portable libraries.<a data-secondary="operating system
support" data-primary="OCaml" data-type="indexterm">&nbsp;</a> Some of the libraries used, however, require a UNIX based
operating system, and so only work on systems like macOS, Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
<code>Core</code> and <code>Async</code> are notable examples here.</p>
<p>This book is not intended as a reference manual. We aim to teach you
about the language as well as the libraries, tools, and techniques that
will help you be a more effective OCaml programmer. But it’s no
replacement for API documentation or the OCaml manual and man pages. You
can find documentation for all of the libraries and tools referenced in
the book <a href="https://v3.ocaml.org/packages">online</a>.</p>
